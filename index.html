            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a rising sophomore at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.
                I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in the College 
                of Engineering. I am also considering minors in AI and Game Design. I 
                grew up in New York City, specifically in Brooklyn, but went to high
                school at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. I have always had a 
                passion for computer science, and specifically for software engineering.
                I am very interested in web and mobile development, but am always eager
                to explore new areas of the field. Outside of tech, I enjoy watching
                movies, listening to music, trying new restaurants, traveling, and 
                playing tennis!
