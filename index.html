      <h2>A Quick Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I am a rising sophomore at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in 
        Computer Science in the College of Engineering. I am also considering minors in AI and Game Design. I 
        grew up in New York City, specifically in Brooklyn, but went to high school at Stuyvesant High School 
        in Manhattan. I have always had a passion for computer science, and specifically for software engineering. 
        I am very interested in web and mobile development, but am always eager to explore new areas of the field. 
        Outside of tech, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, trying new restaurants, traveling, and playing 
        tennis!

      <h3>Middle School</h3>
      <p>I received my first computer, a Toshiba laptop, in elementary school. Aside from playing around with Scratch, my mom 
        signed me up for some coding practice on Tynker and that is when I first realized coding is fun! I would spend days
        leading up to my family members' birthdays making them games on Tynker. It was something original that I could create
        and share with them, and I loved it! This led way to middle school where we had so-called talents that we had to try
        out for to get into the school. I tried out for the computer-math talent and got in! This was when I took my first real
        coding classes. In 6th grade we mostly played around with SketchUp, a 3D modeling program, and flight simulators. In
        7th grade, it was all about robotics and we used Arduino. Then in 8th grade, that's when HTML, CSS, Python, and Photoshop
        came into play. Even though part of the school year was online due to the COVID pandemic, I learned so much about web
        development that year and really enjoyed it.</p>

      <h3>High School</h3>
      <p>During my time at Stuyvesant, I spent time during both the school year and the summer working on computer science. During freshman 
        year, I took an online javascript course from Johns Hopkins University about interactive web development. I learned so much about
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that year and it really solidified my interest in web development. Then during the next school year (my 
        sophomore year), I took Annual Intro to CS, which went into Dr. Racket, Netlogo, and Python. During the summer after freshman 
        year I joined the KWK community when I participated in the iOS Mobile Application Development summer camp. This was truely such a 
        unique experience and only solified my appreciation for software development by introducing me to the world of app development. I 
        took AP Computer Science A during my junior year, where I learned Java and object-oriented programming. I also took part in a 
        Google Mentorship program where I worked in a group of 3 other students and one mentor from Google on a project, ours being a website
        that primarily relied on React. After junior year, I participated in a three-week program at Columbia Univeristy where I learned 
        about data science using Python and machine learning principles. Unfortunately, during my senior year, the programming office didn't 
        place me in any computer science classes, but I was really happy with how much I learned during my time at Stuyvesant.

      <h3>College</h3>
      <p>At Cornell Engineering, I came in as a prospective computer science major. After countless college tours, I settled with Cornell 
        University as my top choice specifically because of its strong computer science program and unique classes. During my first 
        semester I took CS 1998 - Introduction to iOS Mobile Development, a student-led class that taught us both UI Kit and SwiftUI,
        delving into frontend development, backend integration, and Figma design integration. Second semester I took CS 2110 - 
        Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, which utilized Java as the primary language. During my freshman year, I also
        took on a campus job as a student web developer for a professor within the Linguistics department, where I worked on a website 
        for his research utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also joined the technical computer of WICC (Women in Computing at Cornell),
        where I worked on a project to create a website for the organization using React and aided in creating and conducting a Git 
        presentation for the club. After completing my first year, I was already able to apply for affiliation with the computer science
        major and got accepted! During the summer after my freshman year, I moved across the country to Seattle, Washington for an 
        internship at Amazon as a software development engineer intern on the alerting mobile team. I would have never found my love
        for mobile development if it weren't for Kode with Klossy, and I am so grateful for that!
